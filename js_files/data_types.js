//javascript has dynamic typing we dont have to
// declare the type of the value that is stored in the variable

// We have 7 Primitive Data Types all the Rest are Refence data types

//Symbol is 1 of them and BigInt

let booleanType = false;

// we can have null ,eaming an empty value

let emptyValue = null;

// this is a string
let myName = "Kalimeris Spyros";
console.log(myName);

// this is a number
let age = 29;

// we can have undefined
let undifined_type = undefined;

// we can have not a number 
let notAnumber = NaN;

// we can have array
let array1 = [1,2,3,4,45];

// we can have objects
let spyros = {
    age : 29,
    firstname : "Spyros",
    lastName : "kalimeris",
    work : "Programmer"
}

console.log(age);
console.log(undifined_type);
console.log(notAnumber);
console.log(array1);

// We can use the typeof to check the type of the value that the variable holds
