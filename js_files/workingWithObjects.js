// what is the difference between let and var

// var is function scoped
// let is block scoped

// 2) what is a closure.

// a closure happens when a function has access to its parents variables
// if if the parent function has ended execution.
// The closure will consist of all the local variables that were in-scope when the closure was created.

// 3) // Delegation Model

// JavaScriptâ€™s default behavior that allows moving declarations to the top is called Hoisting.
